## 4. Product Sales Forecasting with DCMMs

Data: daily pasta sales (4 items->4 DCMMs)

### Evaluation of Forecasts

#### Four evaluation methods

Basic: fig1

Coverage of forecast distributions

Probabilistic integral transform (PIT)

Frequency aclibration properties of forecasts of 0/positive sales

==Need do: be able to reproduce the forecasts and the 4 figures. (No access to the dataset)==

###Evaluation of DCMM with random effects extension

## 5. Multiscale Sales Forecasting

Data: 17 spaghetti items

**Main point:** comparison of forecasting performance of a multiscale model (with $M_0$) and a set of *individual* DCMMs

**5.1 fit model**

==Try: modify $M_0$ "to incorporate additional predictors of day-of-week effects" and compare the forecasting performances==

**5.2 & 5.3 forecast metrics and forecast comparisons**

==Try: error metrics other than MAD and RPS, read secondary paper==

 

#What's next

1. All of us: understand DGLM, DCMM and its random effects extension and the multiscale model with $M_0$
2. read 3.3.2, appendix and any other related parts of the paper; should be able to implement the models to perform forecasting
3. read secondary paper (MW notes on new families of loss functions) , 5.2, 5.3 and any other related parts of the paper, provide ideas about what error metrics we could try 
4. coding: forecasting and updating, 4 figures, error metrics, etc.
5. Take a look at the supplementary materials (17 pages! technical details on traditional component discounting in DGLMs and the discount factor specification of the random effects extension of DGLMs; additional forecast comparisons for the scaled mean squared error (sMSE); detailed description of extensive comparisons of the DCMM with other existing methods)

1,2,3 should be done first. 

4 is after 3. 

5 partly relies on 2 and is optional.
